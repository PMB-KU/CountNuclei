# ImageJ Nuclei Counter for Fluorescent Images

## Modified ImageJ plugin ITCN

This is a modified version of the ImageJ plugin ITCN. The original plugin is developed by the Center for Bio-image Informatics at UC Santa Barbara, and released on the [ImageJ website](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/itcn.html). It could also be downloaded from the developer's [web page](https://bioimage.ucsb.edu/docs/automatic-nuclei-counter-plugin-imagej) (This version actually works better).

However, because the plugin is developed many years ago, it is no longer maintained and no detailed instructions could be found on the internet. Here I improved the original plugin a little bit so that it could be recorded by and used in ImageJ macro scripts.

### Installation

Download Itcn.zip from this Github directory, unzip, and place it under the ImageJ or Fiji plugins folder, restart ImageJ or Fiji. There will be a new Plugins>Itcn menu path.

* How to find ImageJ plugins folder:  
  * If you are using ImageJ:  
    Open the software and select File>Show Folder>Plugins.  
  * If you are using Fiji:  
    Open the software, close all images and select Image>Show info...  
    ImageJ home information will appear. Go to that folder and there will be a plugins subfolder.
